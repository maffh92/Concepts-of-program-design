Summary on 12-01-2017

We started working on implementing the generic functions of what is used in the
paper of Comparing Datatype Generic Libraries in Haskell in Shapeless. However,
this resulted into a more difficult problem to solve than expected. The reason
for this is that the authors of the Shapeless library did not focus on all the
criteria of the paper. This made some functions of the paper hard to implement.
When we are done writing these function we will compare it to the other generic
libraries in Haskell.

Next, we are working in parallel to implement the EMGM(Haskell generic library)
to Scala. We are not planning to implement all of the default function of EMGM,
due lack of time and some functions are not really interesting for Scala. Also,
it was harder than expected to implement some functions, because Scala does some
things quite different than Haskell. At the moment of writing this summary we
have implemented the Map, Crush, Collect and Everywhere functions. Now we are
focusing on implementing the functions used in the paper in the ported library. 

In the repository everything is in a highly experimental state (and mostly
incomplete), but the implementation and related Scala files can be found under
the folder 'Development'.

We maybe took a little bit of a detour from our planning, but we think for now
everything is going fine.
