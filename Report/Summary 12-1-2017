Summary

We started working on implementing the generic functions of what is used in the paper of Comparing Datatype Generic Libraries in Haskell
in Shapeless. However, this resulted into a more difficult problem to solve than expected. The reason for this is that the authors of the Shapeless library did not focus on all the criteria of the paper. This made some functions of the paper hard to implement. When we are done writing these function we will compare it to the other generic libraries in Haskell.


Next, we are working in parallel to implement the emgm(Haskell generic library) to Scala. We are not planning to implement all of the default function of emgm, due lack of time and some functions are not really interesting for Scala. Also, it was harder than expected to implement some functions, because Scala does some things quite different than Haskell. At the moment of writing this summary we have implemented the Map, Collect, Everywhere and partially the Crush functions. After we can use the Crush functions we will focus on implementing the functions used in the paper in the ported library. 


We maybe took a little bit of a detour from our planning, but we think everything it is going fine.
